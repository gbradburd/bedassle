\usage{
x.validation(partitions.file, n.replicates, n.partitions, geoDist = NULL,
  envDist = NULL, nLoci, prefix, n.iter = 2000, n.chains = 2,
  parallel = FALSE, n.nodes = 1, save.files = FALSE, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{partitions.file}{A filename (in quotes, 
with the full file path) to the data partitions object to be used 
in the k-fold cross-validation procedure.}

\item{n.replicates}{An \code{integer} giving the number of cross-validation
replicates to be run. This should be the same as the length of the list 
specified in the \code{partitions.file}.}

\item{n.partitions}{An \code{integer} giving the number of data folds 
within each run. This should be the same as the length of each the 
list specified for each replicate in the \code{partitions.file}.}

\item{geoDist}{A \code{matrix} of pairwise geographic distances 
measured between all pairs of samples. A value of 
\code{NULL} runs a model without geographic distance 
as a predictor of genetic differentiation.}

\item{envDist}{A \code{matrix} of pairwise environmental distances 
measured between all pairs of samples. If there 
are multiple environmental distance measures, this 
argument should be a \code{list} of distance matrices. 
A value of \code{NULL} runs a model without geographic 
distance as a predictor of genetic differentiation.}

\item{nLoci}{The total number of loci across all data partitions
(the sum across data partitions of the number of loci used in 
calculating pairwise pi specified in the \code{partitions.file} argument.}

\item{prefix}{A character \code{vector} giving the prefix to be attached 
to all output files.}

\item{n.iter}{An \code{integer} giving the number of iterations each MCMC 
chain is run. Default is 2e3.  If the number of iterations 
is greater than 500, the MCMC is thinned so that the number 
of retained iterations is 500 (before burn-in).}

\item{n.chains}{An integer indicating the number of MCMC chains to be run 
in the analysis. Default is 2.}

\item{parallel}{A \code{logical} value indicating whether or not to run the 
different cross-validation replicates in parallel. Default is \code{FALSE}.
For more details on how to set up runs in parallel, see the model 
comparison vignette.}

\item{n.nodes}{Number of nodes to run parallel analyses on. Default is 
\code{NULL}. Ignored if \code{parallel} is \code{FALSE}. For more details 
in how to set up runs in parallel, see the model comparison vignette.}

\item{save.files}{A \code{logical} value indicating whether to automatically 
save the output files from each cross-validation replicate. 
Default is \code{FALSE}.}

\item{...}{Further options to be passed to rstan::sampling (e.g., adapt_delta).}
}
\value{
This function returns a matrix with \code{n.replicates} columns and 
	\code{n.partitions} columns giving the likelihood of each data partition 
	(averaged over the posterior distribution of the MCMC) in each replicate 
	analysis. The mean of these values gives an estimate of the predictive 
	accuracy of the specified model given the data provided. The mean and 
	standard error of the data partition likelihoods across replicates can be 
		used for comparing models (e.g., with a t-test).

In addition, this function saves a text file ("..._xval_results.txt"), 
containing the returned likelihoods for each replicate and data partition.
