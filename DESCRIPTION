Description: A method for modeling pairwise genetic distance as a function of geographic 
	and ecological or environmental distance, for estimating the relative contributions 
	of these distances to genetic differentiation, and for statistically comparing models 
	with different distance predictors (e.g., geographic distance alone vs. geographic AND 
	ecological distance). This package contains code for running analyses (which are 
	implemented in the modeling language 'rstan') and visualizing and interpreting output.
